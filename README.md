## Quickstart

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use GroqNotes, you can use a hosted version at [groqnotes.streamlit.app](https://groqnotes.streamlit.app) or [groqnotes.replit.app](https://groqnotes.streamlit.app).
> Alternatively, you can run GroqNotes locally with Streamlit using the quickstart instructions.




You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various OpenAI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
